## Cox Data Usage
data caps are lame, this should help stay on top of the issue with a simple cli to get the current useage for your account.

## Installation
```npm i```

## Useage
create ```config.js``` with your config for the cox website
run ```node .```

# TODO
 [ ] scraping reliably with puppeteer

 [ ] CLI tool to see this data anywhere once linked

 [ ] use CLI to create config if not present

 [ ] electron desktop widgit frontend
