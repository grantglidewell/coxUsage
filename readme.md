## Cox Data Usage
data caps are lame, this should help stay on top of the issue with a simple cli to get the current useage for your account.

## Installation
```npm i```

create ```config.js``` with your config for the cox website

run ```node .``` to make sure your config is working

run ```npm link```

## Usage
run ```coxusage``` whenever you want to be enraged by your data limit.
